## NRG-CP Dataset

NRG-CP (Energy Chord Progressions) is an open MIDI dataset featuring rhythmic chord progressions in the style of dance, trance, house, and other forms of EDM music. It includes 30,943 files, each 8 bars long, generated from a database of chord progressions in symbolic text format and custom code for rhythm generation. Additionally, the timing information is normalized to 120 BPM at a 96-tick resolution, resulting in a total duration of approximately 516 hours of musical notation.

The dataset was developed to evaluate timing augmentation methods during model training, aimed at enhancing input prompting on repetitive notations.
